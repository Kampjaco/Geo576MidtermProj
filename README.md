Currently, I do not have all of the features I would like implemented to my project.  It is missing the functionality to add points, and to filter the points based on a criteria, such as year of the trip, user who logged the attraction, etc.  I created a more robust ER diagram (which can be found [here](https://github.com/Kampjaco/Geo576MidtermProj/blob/main/images/new_er.png)).  This enhanced ER digram will help in planning out how I want to format the survey.  The styling of the map will be very similar to how it is now, with buttons on the side hiding larger popup menus when clicked.  I likely will include a informational section, either as a splash screen or as a blob of text in a corner of the screen, detailing the point of the map and how to use it.
